Implementation of Asynchronous Backtraking Algorithm (ABT) from Makoto 
Yokoo's book (Distributed Constraint Satisfaction, Springer, 2000), Fig. 3.4,
p.59, with a simplification in the backtrack procedure: all nogoods are not 
computed and sent: only the agent's view is considered as a nogood 
(see remark Section 3.4.1, p.60).
