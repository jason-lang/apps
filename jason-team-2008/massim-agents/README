1. Prerequisites.

You only need the sun-java5 / sun-java6 (jre and jdk) installed to run the server.

2. Installing and running.

·Unpack the file anywhere:
	tar xzvf massim-Server-version.tag.gz -C output_dir

·Switch to the new directory:
	cd output_dir/massim-Server

·Run the script provided in the package:
	./startServer

3. Options.

You can edit the startServer script for changing the ip where the rmi registry
 will be run (variable name), or the location of configuration file:

4. Configuration files
4.1 Server configuration

The serverconfig.xml file is located inside the conf directory. There you can
specify all the parameters refered to the simulation: from the number of agents
to the map style.

The first relevant element is the configuration one. It contains attributes like
the grid's size, number of elements (agents, gold items, obstacles) inside the
grid and some probability parameters.

If no more is specified a random map will be created using the parameters provided.

There is also the capability of creating your map, placing all the elements in their
position.

The easiest way is read the second simulation config from the serverconfig.xml fіle
and understand the array elements.

4.2 Visualization configuration
The visualconfig.xml file is also located inside the conf directory. There you can 
specify parameters refered to the visualization (or svg output files). It allows you
change the colors and sizes of the elements.
