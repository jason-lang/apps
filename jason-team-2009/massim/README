1. Prerequisites

You only need the sun-java6 (jre and jdk) installed to run the server, the
agents and the servermonitor.

2. Installing

·Unpack the file anywhere:
	tar xvfj massim-*.tar.bz2

·Switch to the new directory:
	cd massim/

3. Running

·Server:
	·Run the script provided in the package:
		./startSimulation2009.sh

	·There are two other maps which can be invoked by:
		./startSimulation2009.sh conf/serverconfig90x90_20agents.xml
		./startSimulation2009.sh conf/serverconfig100x100_20agents.xml

	·When all agents are connected you can press >>ENTER<< to start the
	 simulation.

	·To abort the simulation you can press >>CRTL+C<<. Then, the demo agents
         quit as well. 

·Demo agents:
        ·Run the script provided in the package:
                ./startAgents2009.sh

	·You have to specify the ip adress or hostname (usally localhost) of the
	 server and the number of agents (usally 20) you want to execute.

·Servermonitor:
        ·Run the script provided in the package:
                ./startCowMonitor2009.sh
	
	·You can set the ip adress and the rmi port in the following way:
		./startCowMonitor2009.sh localhost 1097

	·Note: Only if a simulation is running (i.e., you pressed >>ENTER<< in
	       the simulation shell) the 2D-window of the monitor appears.


4. Configuration files

·Server configuration

	The serverconfig*.xml files are located inside the conf directory. There
        you can specify all the parameters refered to the simulation: from the number of
	agents to the map style.

	The first relevant element is the configuration one. It contains attributes like
	the grid's size, number of elements (agents, gold items, obstacles) inside the
	grid and some probability parameters.

	There is the capability of creating your map, placing all the elements
	in their position. We also have an experimental (i.e., possible unstable)
	graphical editor which can be asked for.

·Visualization configuration

	The visualconfig.xml file is also located inside the conf directory.
        There you can specify parameters refered to the visualization (or svg output files).
	It allows you change the colors and sizes of the elements.
