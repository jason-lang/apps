Our team can run in three configurations (Jason 0.9.6 is
required):

1. With a local simulator developed by us to test the team. 

   Using JasonIDE, open the project Local-JasonTeam.mas2j and
   run it.

2. With the competition simulator running at localhost.

   Using JasonIDE, open the project AC-Local-JasonTeam.mas2j 
   and run it.

3. With the competition simulator (during the tournament)

   ant -f build-competition.xml
