1. Prerequisites.

You only need at least the sun-java5 or higer installed to run the agents.

2. Installing and running.

·Unpack the file anywhere:
	tar xzvf massim-demoAgents-version.tag.gz -C output_dir

·Switch to the new directory:
	cd output_dir/massim-agents

·Run the script provided in the package:
	./startAgents

3. Options.

You can edit the startAgents script for changing the username and password 
of the agents, the location of their main class or the ip where the server 
is running.
Examples:
	java -classpath <your_classpath> yourAgent username password &
or
	java -jar yourJarFile username password &
or 
	java -jar yourJarFile username password <server_ip> &

4. Creating your agents.
4.1 Obtaining the demostration sources

Inside the demoAgents.jar file there are the sources of the demostration
agents. You can decompress it with the command:
	$ jar xf demoAgents.jar

Three directories will be created:
	META-INF: Contains the MANIFEST.MF of the jar file.
	massim:   Contains all the compiled classes of demoAgents.
	src:      Contains the demoAgent's sources.

4.2 Writting agents.

All agents must inherit from the abstract class massim.AbstractAgent. 
Some agent examples are contained in the massim.demoAgents package.

For more information about the methods of massim.AbstractAgent class, 
please read the java-doc.

4.3 Packing your agent.

You can package your agent inside a jar file. First of all you need a 
manifest file. You can take the example from the demoAgent and edit 
the "Main-Class:" field. There you must point to your class containing 
the main method.

Then the packaging step is as so easy as:
	$ jar cfm yourPackage.jar yourManifest <yourClasses or directories>
