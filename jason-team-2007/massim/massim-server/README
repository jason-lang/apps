1. Prerequisites.

You only need at least the sun-java5 or higer installed to run the server.

2. Installing and running.

·Unpack the file anywhere:
	tar xzvf massim-Server-version.tag.gz -C output_dir

·Switch to the new directory:
	cd output_dir/massim-server

·Run the script provided in the package:
	./startServer

3. Options.

You can edit the startServer script, change the ip where the rmi registry
 will be run (variable name) and the location of configuration file with the
--conf parameter.

4. Configuration files
4.1 Server configuration

The serverconfig.xml file is located inside the conf directory. There you can
specify all the parameters refered to the simulation: from the number of agents
to the map style.

The first relevant element is the configuration one. It contains attributes like
the grid's size, number of elements (agents, gold items, obstacles) inside the
grid and some probability parameters.

If no more is specified a random map will be created using the parameters
provided in configuration file.

There is also the capability of creating your map, placing all the elements in 
their position.

The easiest way is read the second simulation config from the serverconfig.xml 
fіle and understand the array elements.

4.2 Visualization configuration
The visualconfig.xml fіle is also located inside the conf directory. There you
can specify parameters refered to the visualization (or svg output files). You
are allowed to change the colors and sizes of the elements.
