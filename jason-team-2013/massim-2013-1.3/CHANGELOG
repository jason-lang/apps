2013-1.3:
- SVG visualization: Bug fixes and arrows added.
- Statistics observer: Functionality for creating a table for the buying transactions added.
- Bugs in the scenario fixed:
    - The ranged probe action was returning the wrong node.
    - The ranged inspect did not return a result.
    - The map generation was not fully symmetric.

2013-1.2:

- SVG visualization adapted.
- New map generation algorithm.


2013-1.1:

MARSMONITOR:
- Dropdown agents’ list:
    - Items ordered
    - Added “empty” selection.
    - Fixed responsiveness (update instantly at selection, not at next refresh).
- Selected agent marked in map.
- New visualization including
	-different agent polygons
	-lines to the targets of ranged actions (excluding survey)
	-a status field displaying lastAction and lastActionResult


2013-1.0:

MASSIM
- changed node-name-prefix from vertex to v
- bugfixes
- changed behavior of the actions inspect, probe, survey, attack and repair
- statistics: scaled charts to have the same range per simulation
- adapted configuration files for 2013
- added new return-codes for 'lastActionResult'
	-failed_unreachable: target of the goto-action exists, but is not reachable
	-failed_in_range: ranged action failed, because the effective range did not suffice
	-failed_out_of_range: ranged action failed, because the target was outside the visibility range

EISMASSIM
- added entity for 2013 scenario

JAVAAGENTS
- added simple agents for debugging
- added new actions to MarsUtil
- changed some configurations for 28 agents, added debugconfig

2012-2.0:

EISMASSIM:
- reflect agent-type

GENERAL:
- team HempelsSofa team included
- team Targaryen included
- improved shell-scripts

2012-1.0.0:

MASSIM:
- new scenario based on the 2012 one
- scaled up (more agents, bigger maps)
- improved outcome of actions (lastActionResult)
- increased max-energy of all agents to reduce recharges

EISMASSIM:
- added lastActionParam

JAVAAGENTS:
- scripts for two teams a 20 agents

DOCUMENTS:
- updated to reflect the 2012 adaptations


2011-1.0.2:
